# On Policy MCTS for Game Playing
Third project in the course IT-3105 at NTNU

# Purpose

* Apply the general-purpose Monte Carlo Tree Search system - written for the previous project module - to a more complex 2-person game

* Learn to employ a neural network as the target policy (and behavior/default policy) for on-policy MCTS

* Gain proficiency at training policy networks with MCTS and then re-deploying them in head-to-head competitions with other networks
